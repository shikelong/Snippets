	// Place your snippets for typescriptreact here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"React FC Page": {
		"prefix": "reactFC",
		"body": [
			"import React from 'react';",
			"",
			"",
			"interface I${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}Props {",
			"",
			"",
			"}",
			"",
			"",
			"const ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}} = (props: I${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}}Props) => {",
			"",
			"",
			"  return (<div></div>);",
			"}",
			"",
			"",
			"",
			"export default ${1:${TM_FILENAME_BASE}};",
